# What is mrgn?

To begin, it's important to make a clear distinction between different areas of "mrgn", a growing ecosystem of entities and projects that may confuse new users.



* **MRGN, Inc:** The company which initially developed the marginfi protocol, along with some associated web interfaces, software development kits (SDKs), data analytics, and risk management systems.
* **The marginfi Protocol**: **** Intentionally branded in _all lowercase_, marginfi is a suite of persistent smart contracts that together create a composable defi-native prime brokerage, a protocol that facilitates peer-to-peer lending and portfolio management of trader positions across blockchains.
* **mrgnlend:** mrgnlend is an overcollateralized borrow/lend protocol embedded within marginfi. It's the only product live in the marginfi ecosystem today. mrgnlend allows you to borrow, and it allows you to lend.
* **The marginfi Interface:** A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the marginfi protocol. The interface is only one of many ways one may interact with the marginfi protocol.
